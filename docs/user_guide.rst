Installation
============

Using pip
---------

.. warning::

    It is strongly advised with pip to install Lexicon in a Python virtual environment,
    in order to avoid interference between Python modules preinstalled on your system as
    OS packages and modules installed by pip (see https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).

To use Lexicon as a CLI application, do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install dns-lexicon

Some providers (like Route53 and TransIP) require additional dependencies. You can install
the `provider specific dependencies`_ separately:

.. _provider specific dependencies: https://github.com/dns-lexicon/dns-lexicon/blob/main/setup.py#L34-L44

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install dns-lexicon[route53]

To install lexicon with the additional dependencies of every provider, do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install dns-lexicon[full]

You can also install the latest version from the repository directly.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/dns-lexicon/dns-lexicon.git

and with Route 53 provider dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/dns-lexicon/dns-lexicon.git#egg=dns-lexicon[route53]

Using Docker
------------

Lexicon is prepackaged as a Docker image available in the Github Container Registry. The name of the image is ``ghcr.io/dns-lexicon/dns-lexicon``.

You can either use the latest version available, or pin to a specific version (eg. ``ghcr.io/dns-lexicon/dns-lexicon:3.20.1`` to use version ``3.20.1``).

Lexicon CLI flags can be passed directly to the Docker image to execute Lexicon:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --rm ghcr.io/dns-lexicon/dns-lexicon --help

Using your OS package manager
-----------------------------

Lexicon is available in various Linux distributions. Please search for `lexicon` or `dns-lexicon` package in https://pkgs.org.

Usage
=====

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lexicon -h
    usage: lexicon [-h] [--version] [--delegated DELEGATED] [--config-dir CONFIG_DIR] [--resolve-zone-name]
                  {aliyun,...,zonomi}
                  ...

    Create, Update, Delete, List DNS entries

    positional arguments:
      {aliyun,...,zonomi}
                            specify the DNS provider to use
        aliyun              aliyun provider
        ...
        zonomi              zonomi provider

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --version             show the current version of lexicon
      --delegated DELEGATED
                            specify the delegated domain (may not needed if --resolve-zone-name is set)
      --config-dir CONFIG_DIR
                            specify the directory where to search lexicon.yml and lexicon_[provider].yml configuration files (default: current directory).
      --resolve-zone-name   trigger an active resolution of the zone name for the given domain using DNS queries

Using the lexicon CLI is pretty simple:

.. code-block:: bash

    # setup provider environmental variables:
    export LEXICON_CLOUDFLARE_USERNAME="myusername@example.com"
    export LEXICON_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN="cloudflare-api-token"

    # list all TXT records on cloudflare
    lexicon cloudflare list example.com TXT

    # create a new TXT record on cloudflare
    lexicon cloudflare create www.example.com TXT --name="_acme-challenge.www.example.com." --content="challenge token"

    # delete a  TXT record on cloudflare
    lexicon cloudflare delete www.example.com TXT --name="_acme-challenge.www.example.com." --content="challenge token"
    lexicon cloudflare delete www.example.com TXT --identifier="cloudflare record id"

Configuration
=============

Authentication
--------------

Most supported DNS services provide an API token, however each service implements authentication differently.
Lexicon attempts to standardize authentication around the following CLI flags:

- ``--auth-username`` - For DNS services that require it, this is usually the account id or email address
- ``--auth-password`` - For DNS services that do not provide an API token, this is usually the account password
- ``--auth-token`` - This is the most common auth method, the API token provided by the DNS service

You can see all the ``--auth-*`` flags for a specific service by reading the DNS service specific help:
``lexicon cloudflare -h``

Environmental variables
-----------------------

Instead of providing authentication information via the CLI, you can also specify them via environmental
variables. Every DNS service and auth flag maps to an environmental variable as follows:
``LEXICON_{DNS Provider Name}_{Auth Type}``

So instead of specifying ``--auth-username`` and ``--auth-token`` flags when calling ``lexicon cloudflare ...``,
you could instead set the ``LEXICON_CLOUDFLARE_USERNAME`` and ``LEXICON_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN`` environmental variables.

Injection of Lexicon general options also works with environment variables, using the ``LEXICON_`` prefix: for 
instance ``LEXICON_DELEGATED`` can be used to setup the ``--delegated`` option (see next paragraph for the purpose
of this option).

.. code-block:: bash

    LEXICON_DELEGATED=foo.example.com

Resolution of the zone name
---------------------------

Given the provided domain, Lexicon must determine what is the actual zone name that needs to be queried.

If the decision is "easy" for second-level domains (like ``example.com``), it is not the case for higher level
domains. For instance ``example.com`` DNS zone could declare a delegation of subdomain ``sub.example.com`` to
another DNS zone. In this case, a request done to ``sub.example.com`` must correctly that the zone name is
``sub.example.com`` and not ``example.com``.

Lexicon provides two ways to deal with this situation.

TLDextract & ``--delegate``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

By default the tldextract_ library is used by Lexicon to guess the actual zone name from well known top-level
domains (aka TLDs). This works well for second-level domains, like guessing that zone name for ``www.domain.net``
is ``domain.net``.

Lexicon stores ``tldextract`` cache by default in ``~/.lexicon_tld_set`` where ``~`` is the current user's home
directory. You can change this path using the ``TLDEXTRACT_CACHE_PATH`` environment variable.

For instance, to store ``tldextract`` cache in ``/my/path/to/tld_cache``, you can invoke Lexicon
like this from a Linux shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    TLDEXTRACT_CACHE_PATH=/my/path/to/tld_cache lexicon myprovider create www.example.net TXT ...

.. _tldextract: https://pypi.org/project/tldextract/

For higher-level domains, like ``sub.domain.net`` defined to a specific DNS zone, Lexicon would improperly guess that
the zone name is ``domain.net``. To instruct Lexicon here, please use the ``--delegated`` flag with the actual zone name.

For instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create the TXT entry "bar" on FQDN "foo.sub.domain.net" in DNS zone of domain "sub.domain.net"
    lexicon --delegated=sub.domain.net cloudflare create sub.domain.net TXT --name=foo --content=bar

Use of ``--resolve-zone-name``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A more modern approach introduced with Lexicon 3.17.0 is to leverage ``dnspython`` capacities to lookup on the DNS
servers what is the actual zone name of a given domain. In this case ``tldextract`` is not used.

In the example given to the previous section, Lexicon will then be able to directly guess that the zone name is
``sub.domain.net`` and not ``domain.net``.

This option is disabled by default. To activate it, you can pass the flag ``--resolve-zone-name`` to Lexicon.

For instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create the TXT entry "bar" on FQDN "foo.sub.domain.net" in DNS zone of domain "sub.domain.net"
    lexicon --resolve-zone-name cloudflare create sub.domain.net TXT --name=foo --content=bar

In most cases, the ``--delegated`` flag is not needed. However you can still use it if needed to override the
resolved zone name.

Integration
===========

Lexicon can be integrated with various tools and process to help handling DNS records.

Let's Encrypt instructions
--------------------------

Lexicon has an example `dehydrated hook file`_ that you can use for any supported provider.
All you need to do is set the PROVIDER env variable.

.. code-block:: bash

    PROVIDER=cloudflare dehydrated --cron --hook dehydrated.default.sh --challenge dns-01

Lexicon can also be used with Certbot_ and the included `Certbot hook file`_ (requires configuration).

.. _dehydrated hook file: examples/dehydrated.default.sh
.. _Certbot: https://certbot.eff.org/
.. _Certbot hook file: examples/certbot.default.sh

Docker
------

There is an included example Dockerfile that can be used to automatically generate certificates for your website.
